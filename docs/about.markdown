Professor Santo is the founder of VIA MARTIAL ARTS. 

_COMBINE BJJ AND CAPOEIRA BIO_

With over 20 years of Capoeira training he has advanced the art of Capoeira in Ohio with programs in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati. His mission is to foster the development of people of all ages to become confident, engaged, and physically active through the Brazilian art of Capoeira.

His commitment to safe training is paramount. 
Founded in 2009 — Capoeira Brasil is the premiere academy for Capoeira instruction in Ohio, with programs for adults and children.

In addition to Capoeira, Instructor Santo is a Black Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with over a decade commitment to the martial art.

Capoeira teaches self-discipline, control, confidence, character building, and respect, much like other martial arts. Unlike other martial arts, Capoeira reinforces the need for building community, understanding multiculturalism, resolving conflicts without violence, learning a new language, and developing musical abilities. If you are looking for a martial art that offers a holistic approach to benefit you and your children’s lives, Capoeira is the ultimate martial art to study.
