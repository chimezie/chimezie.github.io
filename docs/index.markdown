VIA MARTIAL ARTS is the first and only academy in Ohio fully dedicated to the instruction of Brazilian martial arts – Capoeira and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. 

We believe the physical and mental toughness acquired from training give students “the edge” to succeed in life. 

On day 1 you will feel welcomed, and join a team rooted in focus, work ethic, and encouragement. We train in a challenging yet safe environment to help each student reach their goals. 

VIA MARTIAL ARTS is for EVERYONE!
* Promotes diversity and acceptance
* Ensures amazing fitness
* Teaches discipline and respect for tradition
* Encourages investment in culture
